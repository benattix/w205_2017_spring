3. Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

Answer:
St.Dev.   Procedure
92.3      ED1
61.96     ED2
40.66     OP 18
24.44     Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention
22.18     Head CT results
21.05     Thrombolytic Therapy
17.48     Median time to pain med
16.89     Door to diagnostic eval
16.66     Warfarin therapy discharge instructions
16.33     Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination


First I created a table called proc_variability where I did a union between the hospital scores for effective_care procedures and hospital scores for readmission procedures. This allows me to get the variability for all procedures in both tables. Next, I took the standard deviation for the score of each procedure across all hospitals. Finally, I only included procedures which had scores across at least 10 hospitals. I felt 10 observations is big enough to give us some true variability but not too large that it constrains us by limiting how many procedures we're able to choose from.
